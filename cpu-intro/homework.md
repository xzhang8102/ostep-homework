## Questions

1. Run `process-run.py` with the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100`. What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?) Why do you know this? Use the -c and -p flags to see if you were right.  
**Answer**: The CPU utilization would be 100%. Since there is no other activities than running instructions.  

2. Now run with these flags: `./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0`. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes? Use -c and -p to find out if you were right.  
**Answer**: It would take 11 time units. 4 for the first process, 1 for the second process issuing io, 5 for its io to finish and 1 for the second process to finish.

3. Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why? (As always, use -c and -p to see if you were right)  
**Answer**: 1 time unit for the first process to issue the io which will took 5 time units to finish. Meanwhile, the second process starts running and takes 4 time units to finish. So the total time will be 1 + 4 + (5 - 4) + 1 = 7.

4. Weâ€™ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?  
**Answer**: The two processes will run sequentially which will consume 1 + 5 + 1 + 4 = 11 time units.

5. Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is WAITING for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`). What happens now? Use -c and -p to confirm that you are right.  
**Answer**: Same as the 3rd question.

6. One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it is not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?  
**Answer**: The first process will finish after the latter three processes. The total time consume will be 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 = 31. Apparently there are two IO calls wasting computing time which could have done while the latter two processes runs.

7. Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?  
**Answer**: This strategy will utilize all cpu time efficiently.

8. Now run with some randomly generated processes: `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` vs. `-I IO_RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use -S `SWITCH_ON_IO` vs. `-S SWITCH_ON_END`?
